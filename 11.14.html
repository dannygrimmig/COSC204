                <h3>The Early Promse of the Internet</h3>
                <p>nternet evangelsts argued that new media would create more trustworthy and impartial news sources,
                    weaken political parties, and drastically reduce the impact of lobbyists and special interest groups
                </p>
                <p>Early optimism supported by computer mediated communication studies found that certain features of online communication supported civic engagement ideals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asynchrounous: more time for reflection in communication</li>
                    <li>Anonymous: by being behind an avatar we lose stereotypes</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What happened? What did we get so wrong?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overoptimstic about humanity: we hope humanity uses technology for good... but does tha happen in practice.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Technology and Democracy</h3>
                <p>Multiple careers worth of material on this topic</p>
                <p>Surely many effects we do'nt een know yet</p>
                <p>Going to focus on two topics</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Civil Discourse</li>
                    <li>Civic Engagement</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><em>What is Productive Civil Discourse?</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Willingness to consiider and listen</li>
                    <li>Constructive discussion to perpetuate ideas</li>
                    <li>Find common ground</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Productive Civil Discourse</h3>
                <p>The purpose of civility is not to ensure that the conversation is polite or flows smoothly. It is to ensure that the conversation
                    <strong>fosters democratic goals.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Discourse soley governed by politeness <strong>silences marginalized voices</strong> in an effort to minimize conversational friction.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Perceptions of Online Discourse</h3>
                <p>Compared to other places where people discuss politics, social media discussions are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Less respectful</li>
                    <li>Less civil</li>
                    <li>Less focused on policy</li>
                    <li>Less informative</li>
                    <li>Less likely to come to resolution</li>
                    <li>Angrier</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Strategies for Engaging in Productive Discourse</h3>
                <p>Get comfortable taking your won emotional temperature</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When scrolling through your news feed, it is difficult to take account of your own emotional response</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The best way to be heard is to <em>unintuitively</em> spend less time talking</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take this time to genuinly listen to the opponent and ask questions</li>
                    <li>Restate discussants view in your own words. <em>Did I get that right?</em></li>
                    <li>It feels like you are giving up your ground, but research shoes opponent is more likely to move towards your opinion with this method</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Can be helpful to remind both discussants of common ground (shared values)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Middle Ground vs. Common Ground</h3>
                <p>Middle Ground: if two parties attempt to meet in the middle, often end up ramping up own opinion in hopes to sway result their way</p>
                <p>Common Ground: finding shared values in opinions of each party</p>
            </div>
