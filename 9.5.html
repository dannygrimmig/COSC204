            <div>
                <h3>Ethical Theories</h3>
                <p>Provide a framework for analyzing moral issues</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Internally coherent, consistent, comprehensive, and systematic</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Four Standard Types of Ethical Theories</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consequence Based</li>
                    <li>Duty Based</li>
                    <li>Contract Based</li>
                    <li>Character Based</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Consequence Based Ethical Theories</h3>
                <p>Hold that <strong>consequences</strong> of actions and policies (the ends) are ultimate standard for evaluating moral decisions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have to choose between A and B, pick which has most desirable outcome</li>
                    <li><strong>But... most desirable outcome for whom?</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Utiltarianism: Consequence Based Ethical Theories</h3>
                <p><strong>Utilitarians</strong> argue that you should maximize the best outcome for the greatest number of individuals.</p>
                <div>
                    <p><em>Act (X) or policy (Y) is morally permissible if its consequences produce greates good for greatest amount of people</em></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Famout Utilitarians</h3>
                <p><em>Jeremy Bentham</em> defended the Utilitarian ethical theory with two claims:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Social utility is superior to alternative criteria for evaluating moral systems</li>
                    <li>Social utility can be measured by the amount of <strong>happiness produced</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><em>John Stuart Mill</em> argued that happiness is an <strong>intrinsic good></strong> because people desire it not as a means to one or more ends, but for its own sake.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Trolly Problem</h3>
                <p><em>If a driverless car causes injry or death, who is responsible?</em></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Act vs Rule Utilitarianism</h3>
                <p>Act Utilitarianism claims that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>An act (X) is morally permissible if the consequences produced by doing X result in the greatest good for the greatest number of persons affected by X</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rule Utilitarianism claims that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>An act (X), is morally permissible if the consequences of following teh general rule (Y), of which act X is an instance, would bring greatest good for the greatest number </em></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Problems with Utilitarianism</h3>
                <p>Critics tend to attack two features: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Morality is tied to the production of happiness</li>
                    <li> Morality can ultimately be decided by consequences (of either acts or policies)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Argue that morality can't be grounded in consequences or happiness</p>
                <p><strong>What's wrong with maximizing the production of happiness?</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Duty Based Ethical Theories</h3>
                <p><em>Immanual Kant</em> argued that moralitiy is grounded in duty, or the obligations that humans have to one another</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rejects the notion that morality is tied to the consequences of actions or the promotion of happiness</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Deontological Theories</strong> are theories where the notion of duty or obligation serves as the foundation for morality</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kant argued that our unique rationality as human...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Rule Deontology</h3>
                <p><strong>Categorical Imperative is a rule (or variations on rules) that can be used as an objective and impartial way for determining the basis of our moral oblications</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Always act on a rule that ensures that all individuals will be treated as ends in themselves and not as means to an end</li>
                    <li>Always act on a rule that can be universally binding, without exception, for all human beings (Universality)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Problems with Rule Deontology</h3>
                <p>What if we hae two or more conflicting duties?</p>
                <p>Is it wrong to steal bread to feed your children?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is wront to steal</li>
                    <li>It is wrong to allow your children to starve</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>It is not clear how we should navigate these conflicts under Kant's Deontology</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Act Deontology</h3>
                <p><i>David Ross</i> proposes an <strong>Act Deontology</strong> that weighs the context of each competing <strong>prima facie duties</strong> (self evident duties)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Still rejects the notion that consequences should determine the relative morality of a choice</li>
                    <li>Instead, uses the specific contet of a dilemma to clarify further action</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Relies on <strong>rational intuition</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="takeaways">
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p><i>Utilitarianism</i> focuses on maximizing the most good, either emphasizing teh acts themselves or the general rules under which specific actions fall</p>
                <p><i>Deontology</i> grounds morality in our duty (to respect one another as ends in and of themselves -- and never as means to an end</p>
