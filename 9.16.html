                <h3>Responsibility and Consequences</h3>
                <p>ACM is non binding... but is important to understand. To be discussed later in semester.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Our civic responsibility as computer scientists is something w will continue to explore throughout the semester.</p>
                <p>Who is ultimately responsible for any harmful consequences of technology? Still a question.</p>
