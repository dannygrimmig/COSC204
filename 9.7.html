                <h3>Social Contract Theory</h3>
                <p><em>Thomas Hobbes</em> described a "premoral" state of the world in which individuals were free to act in ways that satisfied their appetites and avoided their "aversion"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any individual is in competition with all others</li>
                    <li>Cost of freedom is a miserable existence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Or rationality allowed us to realize benefits of banding together (social contract)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hobbe's contract states: we are willing to surrender some "absolute freedoms to a sovereign, in exchange for system of rules to protect eachother</li>
                    <li>In this frame, morality is grounded in self interest</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><em>Is (or was) the internet, when first concieved, a Hobbesian premoral state?</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divergence of social rules between the real world comunity vs social media community</li>
                    <li>Lack of true consequences</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><em>Playfullness: Is there an evolutionary purpose for playfulness?</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some researches argue: presence of playfulness in intensely social creatures might point to some adaptive advantage</li>
                    <li>Playfulness may help us navigate tense social situations in a way that does not escalate to violence</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Criticism of Social Contract Theory</h3>
                <p>Social Contract Theory is minimalist</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are only obligated to act morally when formal contract exist</li>
                    <li>Ignores questions of morality outside of a social contract</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Morality is passive</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>focuses on doing no harm rather than doing good</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Rights Based on Contract Theories</h3>
                <p>Based on the assumption that all humans have certain moral or natural rights</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For Example, the inalienable rights enumerated in the U.S Declaration of Independence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rights protected by the state are codified as <strong>legal rights</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Negative Rights:</strong> one has the right not to be interfered with in carrying out priviledges associated. (Example: no one is allowed to interfere with right to vote)</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive Rights:</strong> entiled to under law. (Example: Right to an education)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Character Based Ethical Theories</h3>
                <p><strong>Virtue Ethics</strong> focuses on the development of good character traits and habits</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ethics as a practical science (a practice/skill) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Moral persons are predisposed (through the development of good habits) toward moral actions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognizes that we do not deliberate over each moral question we're faced with on a daily basis</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Criticism of Virtue Ethics</h3>
                <p>Fails to resolve conflicts between competing virtues</p>
                <p>May be less effective in modern, pluralistic society where there are disagreements about the relative importance of different virtues</p>
                <p>In conflict with the individualism present in many Western countries</p>
