                <h3>Human Centered Design</h3>
                <p><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Don Norman</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving."</li>
                    <li>"Ensure that the designs match the needs and capabilities of the people for whom they are intended."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Centers people and their needs, motivations, emotions, behaviour, andperspective in the development of a design. Involving people in 
                    design does not necessarily mean they are centered.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Human Centered Design sees humans as <em>people</em></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Inclusive Design</h3>
                <p>Good for people with disabilities, but often times good for the general public as well!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ex. Yellow strip on railway track</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Exclusive Design</h3>
                <p>Designed to impede an action</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ex. Benches making hard for homeless to sleep</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hostile Archetecture</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Rationalistic vs. Humanistic</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Rationalistic</strong> perspective is primarily focused on technological innovation, efficiency</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can we improve our models, predictions, products?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <strong>Humanistic</strong> perspective is primarily focused on improving human conditions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can we leverage technology as a tool to make lives (of humans) or better</li>
                    <li>Sensitive to context, likely better at identifying unintended consequences</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Drawbacks to Humanistic Approach</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rationalist is very foward facing (future ideal world), Humanist is very here and now. Generally this limits future innovation as a humanist</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Schools of Human Centered Design Though</h3>
                <p><strong>Human Centered Systems</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Technology is interdependent on political, ideological, cultural assumptions</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ex. Children not having to say please and thank you to Alexa</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Technology is influenced by these things, but also influences these things</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Social Design</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The intent and role of the designer is a function of societal forces (ex. socioeconomics, cultural values)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Participatory Design & Inclusive Design</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participatory: Embed the target audience of the technology in the design process</li>
                    <li>Inclusive: Emphasizes the importance of designing for a wide range of human diversity</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer Science's Scale is massive. Ex. Youtube's edge cases are millions of people.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Interaction Design</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By studying the interactions between the human being and the technology (within an ecology), we can...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>How do we practice Human Centered Design?</h3>
                <p>This is a topic for an entire course</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Genereally requires examining human needs, behaviours, experiences, and cognition <em>in sitiuation</em></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Design a model of the experience</li>
                        <li>Design for it</li>
                        <li>Test your design</li>
                        <li>Repeat</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
