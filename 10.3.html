            <div>
                <h3>What is Privacy</h3>
                <p>Class Ideas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom from observation</li>
                    <li>Protect own info: from collection, usage, selling, access</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Brief History of Privacy</h3>
                <p>In Western Thought: Athenian's drew a distinction between public life and domestic life</p>
                <p>14th Century: people went to court for eavesdropping or opening/reading personal letters</p>
                <p>United States: strength of the need for privacy might have roots in huge distances between homesteads</p>
                <p>Historically: privacy has been linked to wealth. Poorer people live/lived in multifamily households, with less privacy.</p>
                <p>Prosser's Privacy (1960): Four torts that would aallow someone whose privaaacy is violated to sue for damages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into private affairs</li>
                    <li>Public disclosure of embarrising private facts</li>
                    <li>Publicity which places a person in a false light in the public eye</li>
                    <li>Appropriation of ones name or likeness</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>A Noise Society</h3>
                <p>"The collective expectation of privacy will increaase, but the individual expectation of privacy will decrease"</p>
                <p>Not enough resources to analyze all members of society, but enough data to analyze specific individuals</p>
                <p>To stay unobserved, it might be better to not use special encryption techniques, but rather just blend in and rely on large numbers.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Why pair privacy with security?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Privacy Laws in the United States</h3>
                <p>There is no one law regulating data collection. Insteaad, privacy is regulated with respect to specific kinds of data (e.g healthcare) or specific popultions (e.g children)</p>
                <p>In the U.S, privacy laws often vary state to state</p>
                <p>The data collected by the vast majority of products people use isn't regulated.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Increased Protections</h3>
                <p>Three states have passed data protection laws</p>
                <p>Further protections include that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>a company must tell you when they are selling your data</li>
                    <li>you can choose whether they can sell your data or not</li>
                    <li>you have the right to access, delete, correct, or move your data</li>
                </ol>
                <p>California law is the strongest. It gives user right to sue companies after a data breach.</p>
                <p>Virgina law is the weakest</p>
            </div>
