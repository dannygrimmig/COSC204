                <p>It is impossible to explain or even talk about labor and automation without some understanding of the history and system in which it exists</p>
                <p>"We stop only the time it takes to oil the engine"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The line between humans and machines was functionally non-existant for industrial capitalist</li>

                <p>Should progress be tempered for the sake of economic stability?</p>
                <p>If so, when and how much and for whom?</p>
                <p>What does it mean to be productive as a human being? As a machine?</p>
