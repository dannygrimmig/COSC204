            <h1>9.9 | Argumentation </h1>
            <div>
                <h3>Critical Reasoning</h3>
                <p><strong>Formal Logic</strong> is concerned with the form or structure of argument</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What does it meant to be logical?</h3>
                <p><strong>Critical reasoning</strong> gives us the tools to clarify our own thinking,
                     analyze the arguments of others, 
                    and persuade others to consider our line of reasoning.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>An Argument (formally defined)</h3>
                <p>Informal: An argument refers to a disagreement or verbal altercation</p>
                <p>Formal: An argument is simply a reasoning form or structure that consists of several claims</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Example Argument</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Premise 1: It is legal to write a book on how to build a bomb</li>
                    <li>Premise 2: Writing a book is ismilar to writing a blog post</li>
                    <li>Conclusion: It should be legal to write a blog post on how to build a bomb</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Invalid: Premise 2 using the word <em>similar</em> invalidates it</p>
                <p>Because the conclusion is a normative claim, we must use the form of reasoning</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Valid vs. Invalid Arguments</h3>
                <p>Arguments are not true or false, they are only valid or invalid</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To determine validity, we ask:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Is there a relationship between the premises and the conclusion such that if all 
                            of the premises in the argument are assumed true, it would be 
                            impossible for the conclusion ot be false?
                        </em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>It is possible for all the claims of an argument (premises and conclusion) to be objectively true, but for the argument to be invalid becausethe premises do not support the conclusion.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Counterexamples</h3>
                <p>To show an argument is invalid, produce a counter example:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Example 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Premise 1: All dogs like sticks</li>
                    <li>Premise 2: Poodles are dogs</li>
                    <li>Comclusion: Poodles like sticks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Valid: No true or false, while this might be false it is still a valid claim.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Sound vs. Unsound Arguments</h3>
                <p>If an argument is valid, then the next question is whether it is sound</p>
                <p><strong>Question 1: True</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Question 2: Unsure</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Example 3</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Premise 1: 90% of Colgate students own an article of maroon clothing</li>
                    <li>Premise 2: John is a colgate student</li>
                    <li>Conclusion: John has an article of maroon clothing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Inductive vs. Fallacious Arguments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inductive</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If an argument is invalid, but the conclusion is still very likely to be true (when we assume the truth of both premises), the the argument is inductive</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Fallacious</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If an argument is invalid, but the conclusion is unlikely to be true (when we assume the truth of both premises), the the argument is fallacious</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Both inductive and sound arguments are considered <strong>strong</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Can you have an argument that is invalid, but still strong?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Informal Logical Fallacies</h3>
                <p><strong>Ad Hominem</strong>: The argument attacks someone's character, using poor character as evidence for conclusion, rather than focusing on substance of debated topic</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most common informal fallacy is in politics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sometimes, a persons character can be debated however in relevence to the debate topic.</p>
                <p><strong>Slippery Slope</strong>: The argument assumes C will follow B, and B will follow from A, etc, without providing for clear evidence for this causal chain</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: "If we allow a man to marry a man, what is to stop a main from marrying a goat"</li>
                    <li> It is ok to make causual chain, only when it is actually relevent (unlike above)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Informal Logical Fallacies</h3>
                <p><strong>Appeal to Authority</strong>: Argument relies on an expert or authority figure's connclusion, even though that expert may 
                not have relevent knowledge on the topic in question</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Ask Fauci about medical advice, but not advice on march madness bracket</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Appeal to Emotion</strong>: Argument that relies on an emotional response rather than evidence</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emotions are an important part of argumentation though (pathos always beats logos)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>False Cause/Post Hoc Egrgo Propter Hoc</strong>: B happened after A, therefor A caused B</p>
                <p><strong>Correlation vs. Causation</strong>: A is associated with B, therefore A causes B</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex/ video games causes you to not afford a house... not relevent</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Equivocation</strong>: Equating two different definitions of the same word. Or sometimes redefining the word in question to suit your needs.</p>
                <p><strong>False Dichotomy</strong>: Presenting an either or choice, when in actuality there are more than two options</p>
                <p><strong>Strawman</strong>: Mischaracterizing your opponents position and then attacking that position instead of the actual one they had</p>

                <h3><em>Freedom of speech is a right, so it is only right that we speak out against vegetarians who want to force
                    us to only ever eat carrots. The choice is clear, freedom or tyranny.
                </em></h3>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Validity has to do with the structure or form of an argument</p>
                <p>Soundness has to do with the truth of the premises of a valid argument</p>
                <p>Inductive arguments are invalid arguments where the conclusion is likely true (assuming the truth of the premises)</p>
                <p>Inductive and sound arguments are both considered strong</p>
                <p>There are many informal logical fallacies, </p>
