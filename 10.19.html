                <h3>Labor Theory of Property</h3>
                <p>Roots in philosophy of John Locke</p>
                <p>Ties property ownership to the labor used to produce the thing</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unclear if this extends to non physical property</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here we see that fundamental to history theories of property is the assumption of scarcity</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Utilitarian Theory of Property</h3>
                <p>Property is not derived from the labor used to create the thing</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rather, property is a practical convention of the state used to maximize good.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The protection of copyright allows creators to publicize their work, benifitting all.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Personality Theory of Property</h3>
                <p>Argues that labor and utilitarian theories require criteria external to the individual to determine property rights</p>
                <p>In contrast, personality theory ties property rights directtly to the persona of the creator</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arguing that the created thing is an extension of the creator and through that relationship deserves protection</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>DMCA</h3>
                <p>Digital Millenium Copyright Act: <em>1998</em></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>protections for online service providers if users engage in copyright infringement</li>
                    <li>ecourage copyright owners to give greater access to their works in digital formats by providing them with legal protections against unauthorized access</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ex: <em>hacking passwords/circumventing encryption</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>making it unlawful to provide false copyright management information</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ex: <em>names of authors and copyright owners, titles of works</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>Critcs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Do you really own anything you buy? ex: buying book on audible, can only read it on audible</em></li>
                    <li><em>Discourages free expression and scientific research</em></li>
                    <li><em>Interferes with fair use rights</em></li>
                    <li><em>Impedes competition and innovation, sometimes far outside of its intentional scope</em></li>
                    <li><em>Apple has used the DMCA to force iPhone to use iOS</em></li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Right to Repair</h3>
                <p>The general idea that when you buy a thing it belongs to you, so you should have the right to do what you like with it (including repair yourself</p>
                <p>Other goals of the movement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>apple uses rare screwdrivers to repair iphones</li>
                    <li>iphone slow google searches increase as new phones are released</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Planned Obsolescence</strong>: the notion that a product is intentionally designed to have a short lifespan, so new product must eventually be purchased</p>
                <p>France:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a crime to intentionally shorten the lifespan of a product</li>
                    <li>2018: France sues Apple for planned obolescence in iPhone</li>
                    <li>Apple had to pay $27 Million</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Copyleft vs. Copyright</h3>
                <p>Copyright states that a created work is protected against unauthorized copying or derivation</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copyleft: <strong>copies or derivations of a created work are freely avaiable</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Banting and Best: <em>"Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world"</em></li>
                        <li>Tim Berners Lee (HTTP): <em>made it free for scientist to add and retrieve knowledge via the web</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Copyright: <em>copies...</em></li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Creative Commons</h3>
                <p>Rather than have IP totally free to use or totally restricted, CC offers tiers of restrictions/features</p>
                <p>For Example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>credit must be given to the author</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Disney recieved the rights to James Earl Joices Voice. Future </li>
                </ul>
                <p>AI Generated Art</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Artists names being used as prompts for AI Generated art... does this devalue the artist if a computer can create similar work?</li>
                </ul>
