                <h3>Group Discussion:</h3>
                Maner argues that <strong>computer use has generated ethical issues that did not exists</strong> before and could not have existed otherwise. 
                Do you agree, or are all new issues just old issues reformated in a new way?
                <ul>
                    <li>Agree: Computing technology is "uniquely fast, uniquely complex, and uniquely coded"</li>
                    <li>Disagree: same ethical issues being brough about in a new light</li>
                </ul>
