                <h3>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h3>
                <p>When a machine or intelligent agent is capable of understanding/learn anything a human cans</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Chinese Room Problem</h3>
                <p>AI researchers have created a program that behaves as if it understands Chinese.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It convincingly passes the Turing test</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Does the machine literally "understand" Chinese or is it merely simuating the ability to understand Chinese</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Imagine: a closed room that contains book w/ the programs operation in English... if I was in this room wouldn't I be able to 
                            reproduce the same answers without being able to understand Chinese?
                        </li>

            <div>
                <h3>Dennett's Argument for Conscious Machines</h3>
                <p>We are each a collection of trillions of macromolecular machines</p>
                <p>All of these are descended from the original self replicating macromolecules</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Alternative Explanations <sub>According to Dennett</sub></h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Embodied Cognition</h3>
                <p>The notion that resoning is rooted in our physical experience in the world</p>
                <p><em>example:</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Happy is up</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Ethical Issues with Artificial General Intelligence</h3>
                <p>How much cognition is required before AI deserves rights? (do we ask the same about people? animals?)</p>
                <p>Do we have a responsibility to treat AI as AGI on the off chance that it is conscious?</p>
                <p>What happens when the boundary between human beings and AGI is blurred?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Singularity</h3>
                <p>Hypothetical future point when technological grown becomes uncontrollable and irreversible</p>
                <p>Notion: an AGI is capable of improvement and replication at a fast rate</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>once AGI is created... inevitably result in artificial superintelligence leading to irrelevance/extinction of the human race</li>
                </ul>
