                <h3>DS #1: People disagree on Solutions to Moral Issues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People disagree on fundamental issues in every academic discipline. That doesnâ€™t make the study or debate of those issues inconsequential.</li>
                    <li>That does not mean everything is up for debate</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Similarly, certain rules or parameters must be met for a claim or theory to qualify as debatable in ethics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Discussions are often muddled by confusions about the type of disagreement in question</li>
                    <li>Are we having a disagreement about principles or a disagreement about facts?</li>

            <div>
                <h3>DS #2: Who Am I to Judge?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally, people are comfortable describing different moral beliefs, but less comfortable making judgements about those beliefs.</li>
                    <li>Can you practice normative ethics without making judgements about the beliefs and actions of others?</li>
                    <li>Making judgements vs being judgemental</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>DS #3: Morality is a Private Matter</h3>

                    <li>If this were true, what you believe to be moral would be moral.</li>
                    <li>This view could be described as moral subjectivism</li>
                    <li>Are there any problems with moral subjectivism?</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>DS #4: Morality is something cultures decide</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moral Relativism is the belief that we should not (or cannot) make moral judgements about the behavior of people who live in cultures other than our own</li>
                    <li>Is this closer to descriptive ethics or normative ethics?</li>
                    <li>Moral relativsm is the normative extension of cultural relativism</li>
                    <li>Are there any problems with moral relativism</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Moral Absolutism vs Moral Objectivism</h3>
